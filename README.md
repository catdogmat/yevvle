E-Ink ESP32 powered Watch that can run solely on solar power!

## What is it?

The main porpose of LightInk project is to have a functional and basic E-Ink watch that can be powered via Solar cell entirely. The power consumption is around 2uA just updating time, therefore a 200mAh battery like "Watchy" has can last around 400 days! (or powered by a small solar cell)

The project is based around the "Watchy" idea, but requires specific HW to reach these low power levels. Basically differs in:
* Has a better TPS63900 power source of 2.6/2.9V
  * More efficient (DC-DC 75nA quiscent, 1A, 1.8-5V regulation, which 2 configurable voltages)
  * This is enough to power ESP32/RTC/Eink and WiFi under all conditions
* Does not have accelerometer (too much power!, even disabled, uses 1uA)
* Does not have solar cell regulation, is connected directly to batery
* Piezo speaker support
* LED light to see display in dark
* Capacitive touch instead of buttons
* Support for LORA/GPS, but yes, they use too much power! (only turn on to send a signal)

## What is done already ?

The project goals are:
- [X] Ultra low consumption <0.5 mAh/day!
  - [X] Custom Display Driver, reduce booster times/ LUT, etc..
  - [X] Implement a uSPI and display update from wake sleep stub (<1ms! ESP32 on time)
- [X] Basic UI functionality and Widgets
- [X] Features
  - [X] LED light
  - [X] Vibration
  - [X] Speaker
  - [X] GPS
  - [X] Lora receive, BPSK send signals
- [X] Time accurate

## How to build the firmware?

It should be quite straightforward:
Just clone everything (`git submodule update --init --recursive`)
`cd firmware && ./setup.sh && idf.py build flash monitor`

## Helping the project

Just push to a non protected branch and ask for PR.
Any contribution is welcomed.
